## Cross-browser testing

‚≠êÔ∏è Cross-browser functional bugs rarely exist in today's web technology and doing cross-browser functional testing on an entire test suite is inneficient

‚≠êÔ∏è It's more common to find cross-browser rendering issues, especially for responsive web apps. This problem is solved with visual testing.

* Go to 
* Add `[TestFixtureSource(typeof(TestConfigData), nameof(TestConfigData.PopularDesktopCombinations))]` to the top of the class
* Run the tests and notice how fast the parallel build is
* Check out the [Insights Tab](https://app.saucelabs.com/analytics/test-overview)

üéñSuccess is when all the tests run
